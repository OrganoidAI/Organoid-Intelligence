# Humanoid AI

## Overview

We have access to an API from **FinalSpark's NeuroPlatform**, allowing us to experiment with **Organoid Intelligence (OI)**â€”a revolutionary technology based on lab-grown human brain cells. Unlike traditional AI, OI exhibits biological neural activity, making it **more energy-efficient** and **powerful**.

This is just the beginning. With this API, we will run experiments, push the limits, and explore what OI can do. Stay tuned for sneak peeks and exciting discoveries!

## What Makes Organoid Intelligence Unique?

- **Biological Computation**: Uses living brain cells for processing power.
- **Energy Efficient**: Consumes significantly less energy compared to silicon-based AI models.
- **Adaptive Learning**: Shows promising capabilities in learning and neural activity.

## Example API Usage
To get started with the API, here's a basic example of how to connect and send data:

```python
import requests

API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
BASE_URL = "https://api.finalspark.io/"

# Check connection status
def check_status():
    response = requests.get(f"{BASE_URL}status", headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"})
    return response.json()

print(check_status())

# Send data for processing
def send_data(task, data):
    payload = {"task": task, "data": data}
    response = requests.post(f"{BASE_URL}process", json=payload, headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"})
    return response.json()

response = send_data("image_recognition", "image_url_here")
print(response)
```

## Stay Updated
We will be sharing updates, results, and potential applications as we continue experimenting. Follow our journey as we redefine intelligence beyond AI!
